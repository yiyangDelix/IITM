With the launch of the URLLC (Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communication) standard for 5G,
low latency has become a fundamental requirement for almost all network systems.
Traditional resource distribution and absolute latency values affect the service efficiency
of computer networks, so virtualization and low latency are extremely essential for new services
such as smart grid, driverless system and remote medical care.
However, the combination of virtualization and low latency is quite challenging.
In this work, virtualization and latency optimization will be covered.
The focus is on containers and virtual machines, two of today's most advanced virtualization methods.
Afterwards, different latency optimization techniques are explored.
Finally, an analysis and outlook on the combination of the two is presented.
