\section{Motivation}
Real-time systems have been gradually integrated into our life and future, such as
the video conferencing, virtual reality, the industrial control systems and
IoT-based Smart Cities\cite{b19}.
In these systems, especially hard real-time systems, the traditional physical hardware
resources have been difficult to meet the computational demands during the program execution.

Virtualization is the transformation of physical resources into logically
manageable resources which breaks down the barriers between physical structures.
In the context of 5G, resource sharing and optimization become particularly relevant.
In addition, network performance and response time have become a non-negligible part
of the puzzle.
Nowadays, the reduction of the impact of virtualization on predictability and low latency
has become one of the most significant research topics\cite{b13}.
